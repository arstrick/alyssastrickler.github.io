### More Information

This blog is intended as a space for me to practice writing--if you're reading this, welcome! I started this blog because I love reading trip reports, and thought that I could pay it forward by writing a few of my own. I also love answering my studentsâ€™ questions about linguistics and teaching my friends snippets of what I know, so if you have a question about phonetics, sound chaange, or speech perception that you think I could answer, please send me an email!
